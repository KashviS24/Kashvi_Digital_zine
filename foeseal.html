            His sound is a blend of the elements from his surrounding which he grew up listening to and experiencing since he was a child . 
            Blending eastern instruments and melodies with hard hitting drums with inspiration ranging from underground to globally celebrated musical arrangements , he likes to experiment and keep expanding his sound palette .
        </p>
        <p>
            He likes to produce easy listening pop songs once in a while but if he were to describe his sound it's more of fusion of western and eastern music especially eastern instruments with hip hop , trap drum arrangements .
