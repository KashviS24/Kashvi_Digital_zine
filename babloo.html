            Experimental sound artist based out of jhumri talaeya or New Delhi we'll never know. Not much is known about the intentionally undercover Babloo Babylon, whose appearances are few and far between. 
            His innovative productions re-contextualise samples from Indian film-music.

            This enigmatic artist who plays with a mask, has managed to play across several festivals in India and stream worldwide on Boiler Room.
